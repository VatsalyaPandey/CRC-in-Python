# CRC-in-Python
# What is CRC?
A cyclic redundancy check is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to digital data.

# About:
this project lets you perform the CRC on the same machine using the principles of socket programming.

# Pre-requisites required-
-XOR gate
-Theoretical basis of crc
-Socket programming for server and client
